# 4. Jasmine tests



Jasmine is an open source testing framework from Pivotal Labs that uses behaviour-driven notation resulting in a fluent and improved testing experience.

Main concepts:

1. Suites — describe\(string, function\) functions, take a title and a function containing one or more specs.
2. Specs — it\(string, function\) functions, take a title and a function containing one or more expectations.
3. Expectations — are assertions that evaluate to true or false. Basic syntax reads expect\(actual\).toBe\(expected\)
4. Matchers — are predefined helpers for common assertions. Eg: toBe\(expected\), toEqual\(expected\). Find a complete list here.
